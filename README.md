* Ajax-Solr only has one active query of components active at each application, this extension allows to have multiple active queries 
** query terms can be used to define different inital sets and these can be fixed.
** User filters can be spread to different query sets which still keep the original sets.
* Widgets show the results of the query. In this extension some of the Widgets operate on multiple query sets, and allow to compare them. 
* Some extra widgets are added with different functionalities:
** Statistic tagcloud, that compares between sets or with the base set (being the base set the first query performed)
** some graphic widgets
